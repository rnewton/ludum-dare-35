    Welcome to Mathematica Arcanana! In this game, you play as a warrior of the Shape Kingdom, valiantly defending the secret maths of shapehood from the evil army of Amorphous Blobs.<p/>
    <img src="tutorial_images/shot2.png"><br/>
    You as a triangle! Using your spin attack, you must defend the pieces of the central Dodecagram from being stolen by the attacking blobs.<p/>
    <img src="tutorial_images/shot3.png"><br/>
    If a blob steals a piece of the Dodecagram, you must kill them before they leave the arena and retrieve the piece!<br/>
    Killing blobs will also cause coins to drop.<p/>

    As you earn coins, you can transform into other shapes by accessing the shop!<br/>
    To get to the shop, hover over your coin total, and select the next shape you want to buy.<br/>
    Shape prices are listed, but will increase with each transformation!<p/>

    This is the square, with its powerful dash attack! You can also become a hexagon, which shoots spears in all directions!<br/>
    Experiment with all of the shapes to see how many waves you can make it through!<br/>
    But be careful - the blobs will change their behavior each time you change!<p/>
    Good luck!
